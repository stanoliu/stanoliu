title: "Introduction"
---
My family and I have lived in West Philadelphia for 3 years now.  We love the neighborhood because of it's proximity to work and our kids' school.  The neighborhood is also our source for social interactions with friends that we've gotten to know through the local daycare and through the local public school.  The local public school was established in 2001 with the assistance of the University of Pennsylvania.  The area surrounding the school has changed significantly over the last 17 years.  One thing that I've been interested in is how the presence of the school has affected housing prices within the school's catchment compared to the houses outside of the catchment.  The official catchment map can be found on the link below.
